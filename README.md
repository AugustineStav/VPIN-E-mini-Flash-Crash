# VPIN-E-mini-Flash-Crash
VPIN analysis of the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash

This code is a component of the work done in Augustine Stav's "High frequency trade direction prediction": http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5f1439rs
Please see section 2.1: The Volume Syncronized Probability of Informed Trading Model (VPIN) for a description of this model which measures the affect of informed traders on market makers.

From the abstract:
High frequency trading involves large volumes and rapid price changes. The Volume Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) metric characterizes order flow toxicity. This toxicity is the unbalance of order flow between informed traders who possess knowledge of future price directions and market makers who do not have this information. VPIN requires trades to be classified as buys or sells and works with volume as a proxy for information arrival.
